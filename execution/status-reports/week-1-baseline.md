## Summary
The project was formally initiated, stakeholders aligned on objectives, and baseline performance metrics were established. Initial discovery confirmed gaps in KPI clarity and reporting consistency, reinforcing the need for a standardized performance framework.

## Key Activities Completed
- Confirmed project objectives, scope, and constraints
- Identified key stakeholders and communication cadence
- Established baseline KPI definitions and data sources

## Baseline Observations
- Performance metrics were available but inconsistently interpreted
- Reporting focused on short-term fluctuations rather than trends
- Limited documentation existed linking operational changes to outcomes
- Stakeholders expressed interest in clearer, more actionable insights

---

## Risks & Issues
- **Risk:** Data lag may delay visibility into recent changes  
  **Mitigation:** Emphasize trend-based analysis over point-in-time results

- **Risk:** KPI interpretation varies across stakeholders  
  **Mitigation:** Reinforce standardized definitions and usage guidelines

---

## Decisions Made
- Adopt a trend-based reporting approach rather than weekly variance focus
- Prioritize a small set of core KPIs for clarity and adoption
- Maintain a weekly status reporting cadence

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize KPI framework and documentation
- Design reporting structure and templates
- Begin monitoring performance following upcoming operational changes
