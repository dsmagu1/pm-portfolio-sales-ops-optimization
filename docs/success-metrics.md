# Success Metrics & KPI Framework  
**Sales Performance Optimization Initiative**

---

## Purpose
This document defines the success metrics used to evaluate sales performance and assess the impact of operational and strategic changes. The goal was to establish a consistent, interpretable KPI framework that supported faster feedback loops and data-informed decision-making.

All metrics are directional and anonymized.

---

## Principles for Metric Selection
The KPI framework was designed around the following principles:

- Metrics must be actionable, not just descriptive
- KPIs should reflect controllable operational behaviors
- Definitions must be consistent across teams and reporting periods
- Metrics should support trend analysis, not one-off comparisons
- Complexity should be minimized to improve adoption

---

## Primary KPIs

### 1. Conversion Rate
**Definition:**  
Percentage of inbound opportunities resulting in a completed sale.

**Why it matters:**  
Serves as a core indicator of sales effectiveness and customer engagement.

**Used to evaluate:**  
- Impact of script or process changes  
- Performance consistency across shifts  
- Effectiveness of operational adjustments

---

### 2. Productivity / Throughput
**Definition:**  
Volume of handled opportunities or completed transactions per defined time period.

**Why it matters:**  
Balances performance outcomes with capacity and workload considerations.

**Used to evaluate:**  
- Efficiency of operational workflows  
- Impact of process changes on output  
- Sustainability of performance improvements

---

### 3. Schedule Adherence
**Definition:**  
Degree to which agents adhered to planned schedules and availability expectations.

**Why it matters:**  
Directly influences staffing efficiency, customer wait times, and overall productivity.

**Used to evaluate:**  
- Operational discipline  
- Effectiveness of workforce planning  
- Root causes of performance variability

---

### 4. Performance Stability
**Definition:**  
Consistency of KPI trends following operational or strategic changes.

**Why it matters:**  
Highlights whether changes lead to sustained improvement or short-term volatility.

**Used to evaluate:**  
- Risk associated with strategy changes  
- Need for additional adjustment or rollback  
- Maturity of operational processes

---

## Secondary Indicators
These metrics provided supporting context but were not used as primary success criteria:

- Call or interaction volume
- Average handling patterns (directional only)
- Trend deviations by shift or cohort
- Lag indicators following major changes

---

## Reporting Cadence
- **Weekly:** Trend monitoring and early signals
- **Bi-weekly:** Impact assessment following operational changes
- **End-of-phase:** Summary insights and recommendations

Reports focused on trends, directionality, and comparative analysis rather than absolute values.

---

## Interpretation Guidelines
To avoid misalignment and overreaction:

- Single-week variances were not treated as definitive
- Trends were evaluated across multiple reporting periods
- Metrics were reviewed in combination, not isolation
- Contextual factors were documented alongside results

---

## Risks & Limitations
- Data lag could delay insight into recent changes
- External factors could influence short-term results
- Limited control over upstream policy or system changes
- Metrics reflected operational outcomes, not individual performance management

---

## Outcome
The KPI framework enabled clearer visibility into performance drivers, improved alignment between stakeholders, and supported faster, more confident operational decision-making.

The framework was designed to be reusable for future initiatives with minimal modification.
